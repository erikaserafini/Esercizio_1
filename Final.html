        <h2> Ingredients </h2>  
        
            <ul>For the focaccia:
                <l1>4 Cups (500g) all-purpose flour</l1>
                <l2>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</l2>
                <l3>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</l3>
                <l4>1 3/4 cups (350g) lukewarm water </l4>
                <l5>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan</l5>
            </ul>

            <ul>For the topping:
                <l1>3 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced</l1>
                <l2>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</l2>
                <l3>1-2 tablespoon olive oil, for brushing on top </l3>
                <l4>10 ounces brie, cut into cubes (scrape rind off with a paring knife if desired, through it's not necessary) </l4>
                <l5>1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries</l5>
            </ul>


        <h2> Method</h2> 
        
            <ol>
                <l1>Make the focaccia dough

                    In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I sometimes knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the last of the flour...
